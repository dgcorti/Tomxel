      <h1>Wilhelm Kleine Zimmermann</h1>
      <h2>Founder of the enterprise</h2>      
      <p>Tomxel was born as a young company in 1985. It was created in a garage located at The Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. The principal idea of Zimmermann was developing and financing projects and expand, so the company grew very abruptly at 1990. Unfortunately, the founder is not anymore with us, he died during a desert storm fighting in favour of his natal Nation Israel in 1994. His ashes rest in Ganges River.  </p>

He takes the most important decisions about the business policy and strategy. As the leader,  he asesores the group of directors, motivates the employees and changes the units in the organization, and as the gerent, he presides the operations of the organization. In one of his classical phrases he says “excuse me, do you have fire?”</p>

      <h3>Ronaldinho Reloaded dos Santos Moreira</h3>
      <h4>COO</h4>      
      <p>With Brazilian origines, for him nothing comes better than a total laziness afternoon at the beaches of the bay drinking a cachacita with a lost view at the sea. In one of his phrases he says: "Sopa do macaco uma delicia KKKKKK" "Tristeza não tem fim, felicidade sim". He supervises the operations to make sure that the systems of the enterprise are being executed at an efficient way. He is the eyes and ears of the executive director, because the CEOs are often too occupied to supervise the usual operations. </p>
