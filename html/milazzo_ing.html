      <h2 class="text-center">Project carried in 2002 and ended in 2003.</h2>      
      <p class="text-center">During the year 2002 we received a  denouncement of a man called Franco Milazzo who was pretending to be part of our enterprise in order to steal from people. Then, in an attempt to make him stop bothering us, we sent him to the forest of “Chaco Santiagueño” a year so he could solve various legal problems that he left to us. We made him believe that it all was a reality show conducted  by Santiago Bal, if he survives a year in that forest he would win a million dollars. After a year we asked a signal of his stopping place, we believed that had died or worse, he would have realized that it all was our hoax and he would swear to vengeance. In the year 2003 he had to dismiss many employees due to their incapacity of finding our target. By the ending of the same year it happened what we were thinking, Milazzo returned and thirsty for revenge. But in that moment we had another operative in mind. We made him believe that it all was an entertainment for the final fase, a mission very important, go inside the hearth of the shadows, at the Middle East and kill one of the men most wanted of the planet Earth, Osama Bin Laden. The last time that we have seen Milazzo was the 24th of December in 2003 with this words: “I’m going to find that turkey and i'm going to put him in the coat”. In the year 2011 news of the most importance arrive in our hands and the world’s, “The International terrorist Osama Bin Laden has died”. Our final  conclusion was that Franco Milazzo after the eight years of searching and combat finally managed to assassinate his target.</p>
